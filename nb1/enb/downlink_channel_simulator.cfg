/* Downlink Channel simulator */
/* The channel simulator applies after the DL modulator(s) on each RF port using the configured
    sample rate. It takes cell.n_antenna_dl channels as inputs (n input) and may output a
    different number of channels (n output) (see the global n_antenna_dl parameter).
    It applies a number of delay paths with a configurable gain and phase for each n input x
    n output antenna combination. Each path can also appply a Rayleigh fading (Jakes or Gaussian
    fading model). In case of MIMO channels, a configurable MIMO correlation matrix is applied
    for each path. Then a white Gaussian noise is added (AWGN).
