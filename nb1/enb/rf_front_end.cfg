//This file is used to manually tune the Tx gain offset for each individual LTE band.
//As the PicoLTE supports four downlink channels (labeled 1, 2, 3 and 4 on the PicoLTE front panel), 
//four sets of gain offsets are present in this file. A positive value attributed to a GoX_Y parameter
//means that the Rf front end will increase the power by the specified dB value on 
//downlink channel Y if the LTE stack is configured to use LTE band X. 
//For example, if one uses band 3 and notices that downlink channel 1 transmits at -2 dBm while
//the power_output parameter of file rf_driver-xxx.cfg is set to -1 dBm, one should increment 
//parameter Go3_1 by 1 dB.
